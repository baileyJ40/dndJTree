# dndJTree

A Java library designed to extend the Swing Jtree to allow drag-and-drop
capabilities for the individual nodes to other parts of the tree, and to
allow nodes to be selectively hidden from view via a filter.

## Usage

I wrote this library in 2010 for a personal project, so I'm going to have to
brush up on what I did before I can be confident that I am correctly
describing its usage!

There is an example test or two in the source that can be built and played
around with that may help in understaning how the pieces fit together.

If memory serves, there is a pretty bad bug where a parent node that is
drug to become a child of another node will lose all of its children.
